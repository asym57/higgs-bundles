\section{Introductory motivation}

Suppose given a compact Riemann surface $C$
of genus $g \ge 2$ and a compact connected 
Lie group $G$, e.g. $G = U(1)$, $G = SU(2)$. 
Built from these data there is a
moduli space $$\cM = \cM^H(C,G)$$
It is \ti{almost} a manifold --- has some singularities, but also
some components without singularities, and at first we can focus
on the parts without singularities.
It can be seen in various ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\cM$ is the (twisted) \ti{character variety}, i.e. moduli space of
(twisted) 
reductive representations\footnote{``Reductive'' means the closure of 
the image is a reductive subgroup of $G_\C$.}
$\pi_1(C) \to G_\C$.
e.g. for $g=2$ and $G = SU(2)$, 
this means
\begin{equation}
  \cM = \{ A_1,A_2,B_1,B_2 \in SL(2,\C): A_1 B_1 A_1^{-1} B_1^{-1} A_2 B_2 A_2^{-1} B_2^{-1} = \pm 1 \} / \sim
\end{equation}
\item $\cM$ is the moduli space parameterizing (stable) \ti{flat $G_\C$-connections}
over $C$. (Certain sheaves on this moduli space are 
basic objects on ``$B$ side'' of the geometric Langlands correspondence.)
\item $\cM$ is a partial compactification of $T^* \Bun(C,G)$, where $\Bun(C,G)$ is the moduli space of semistable $G$-bundles on $C$. (Lagrangian submanifolds are related to \ti{D-modules} on $\Bun(C,G)$, basic objects on ``$A$ side'' 
of the geometric Langlands correspondence.)
\insfig{higgs-bundles-2}{0.55}
\item $\cM$ is a \ti{complex integrable system} \cite{MR88i:58068}, i.e. a holomorphic
symplectic space fibered over a complex base with Lagrangian
fibers, generic fiber a compact complex torus. \insfig{higgs-bundles-1}{0.8}
\item $\cM$ is a noncompact \ti{Calabi-Yau space}, i.e. a \kahler
space admitting a Ricci-flat metric, in some sense a close 
cousin of the K3 surface; from this point of view
it is a paradigmatic example of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow
philosophy \cite{Strominger:1996it}, 
which says that every Calabi-Yau space arises naturally
as a special Lagrangian \ti{torus fibration} over a complex base,
and that its \ti{mirror} can be obtained by a natural fiberwise duality
operation; moreover in this case the mirror is a space of the same kind,
namely $\cM^\vee = \cM^H(C,^L G)$ where 
$^L G$ is the \ti{Langlands dual} group \cite{mlh,MR2957305}.
(The mirror symmetry
exchanges the two sides of the geometric Langlands correspondence.)
\item $\cM$ is a \ti{cluster variety}, built by gluing together
very simple pieces $(\C^\times)^n$ in an essentially \ti{combinatorial} way. (Almost: to make this precisely true, we have to include \ti{punctures} on $C$; but even without the punctures, some cluster-like
structure seems to persist.)
\item $\cM$ is the space of solutions of an interesting PDE, \ti{Hitchin's equations} \cite{MR89a:32021}, containing as special cases various sorts of harmonic maps (including \ti{uniformization} in the case $G = PSU(2)$).
\end{itemize}

How can one space $\cM$ be so many different things at once?

A partial answer comes from another structure $\cM$ carries, namely
the \ti{\hk} structure. This says in short that $\cM$ has a 
metric compatible with many
different complex structures,
fitting together in a specific way; thus $\cM$ gives rise to
many complex manifolds which look quite different from one
another, but are nevertheless canonically diffeomorphic.
Loosely speaking, one complex structure comes from the Riemann 
surface $C$, another comes from $G_\C$.
An \hk structure is rather rigid and gives a lot of constraints, e.g.
it implies that the metric on $\cM$ is Ricci-flat, and even lets 
us say some things about what the metric looks like (much
more than we can say for ``generic'' Ricci-flat metrics);
also allows us to study the \ti{topology} of $\cM$, e.g. 
its Betti numbers.

Our first major aim is to understand this structure --- first 
we will study some simpler ``baby'' examples of \hk geometry, then
we will study $\cM(C,G)$ for $G = U(1)$, finally we will
come to $\cM(C,G)$ for general $G$.

(A fuller answer should come from the way $\cM$
fits into supersymmetric quantum field theory; but this is 
mostly beyond the scope of this course.)


\section{Symplectic geometry: some facts}

This is mainly intended as a review
and to fix some notation. \fixme{should put some
references here?}

\begin{defn}[Nondegenerate $2$-form]
Suppose $V$ is a vector space over $\R$ or $\C$.
We say $\omega \in \wedge^2(V)$ is \ti{nondegenerate}
if the map
\begin{align}
  V &\to V^* \\
  v &\mapsto \iota_v \omega = \omega(v,\cdot)
\end{align}
is an isomorphism.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}[Standard basis for a nondegenerate $2$-form] 
\label{prop:standard-nondegenerate-2-form}
If $V$ is a vector space over $\R$ or $\C$, and
$\omega \in \wedge^2(V)$ is nondegenerate, then $V$ has 
dimension $2n$ for some $n$, and there
exists a basis $\{e_1, \dots, e_n, f_1, \dots, f_n\}$ for $V$
such that
\begin{align}
\omega(e_i, f_j) &= \delta_{ij}, \\
\omega(e_i, e_j) &= 0, \\
\omega(f_i, f_j) &= 0.
\end{align}
\end{prop}

\begin{defn}[Symplectic manifold]
A \ti{symplectic manifold} is a pair $(X,\omega)$
where $X$ is a smooth manifold and
$\omega \in \Omega^2(X)$, such that
\begin{equation}
  \de \omega = 0
\end{equation}
and $\omega(x)$ is nondegenerate for every $x \in X$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Moment map]
Suppose $X$ is a symplectic manifold, with symplectic form $\omega$,
acted on by a real Lie group $G$, with Lie algebra
$\fg$. By differentiating the $G$-action at the identity,
we obtain a map
\begin{equation}
  \rho: \fg \to \Vect(X).
\end{equation}
Suppose given a function
\begin{equation} \label{eq:moment-map}
 \mu: X \to \fg^* 
\end{equation}
and for $Z \in \fg$ write $\mu_Z = \mu \cdot Z$.
We say $\mu$ is a \ti{moment map} for the $G$-action if 
for all $Z \in \fg$ we have
% \begin{equation}
%   \rho(Z) = \omega^{-1}(\de \mu_Z),
% \end{equation}
% i.e. for any $v \in \Vect(X)$
% \begin{equation}
%   \omega(\rho(Z), v) = v (\mu_Z),
% \end{equation}
% i.e.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:moment-map-condition-3}
  \iota_{\rho(Z)} \omega = \de \mu_Z.
\end{equation}
(Some authors would require in addition that the 
map \eqref{eq:moment-map} should be $G$-equivariant.)
\end{defn}
In particular, the moment map $\mu$ 
\ti{determines} the $G$-action.

Note that moment maps do not always exist.
At the very least, the existence of a moment
map requires that $\iota_{\rho(Z)} \omega$ is closed
for all $Z \in \fg$, by \eqref{eq:moment-map-condition-3}. Using 
Cartan's ``magic formula''
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cartan-magic-formula}
  \cL_v \omega = \de (\iota_v \omega) + \iota_v (\de \omega)
\end{equation}
and the fact that $\de \omega = 0$,
this is equivalent to requiring $\cL_{\rho(Z)}\omega = 0$,
i.e. the $G$-action preserves $\omega$.
But even if the $G$-action preserves $\omega$,
a moment map still may not exist.

\begin{exercise}
Suppose $X = \R^2$ with $\omega = \de x_1 \wedge \de x_2$, and
$G = SO(2) = U(1) = \{e^{\I \alpha}: \alpha \in \R \}$.
Then $\fu(1)$ is $1$-dimensional, spanned by $\partial_\alpha$.
Show that the rotation action of $U(1)$ on $X$ 
has a moment map $\mu: \R^2 \to \fu(1)^*$, given by
\begin{equation}
  \mu(x_1,x_2) \cdot \partial_\alpha = -\half (x_1^2 + x_2^2).
\end{equation}
\end{exercise}
Thus if we identify $\fu(1) \simeq \R$ using the generator
$\partial_\alpha$, we can think of $\mu$ just as an $\R$-valued function
on $X$,
\begin{equation}
  \mu(x_1,x_2) = -\half (x_1^2 + x_2^2).
\end{equation}


\section{Local complex and \kahler geometry: a quick review}

This is only intended as a review and to fix notation.
There are many references for this material: one
good one is \cite{MR2093043}.


\subsection{Complex manifolds} 
In this section $X$ is a smooth manifold.

\begin{defn}[Almost complex structure]
An \ti{almost complex structure} on $X$ is a smooth section $I$ of $\End(TX)$ with $I^2 = -1$. An \ti{almost complex manifold} is a pair $(X,I)$ where $I$ is an almost complex structure.
If $X$ has real dimension $2n$, an almost complex
structure $I$ equips $TX$ with the structure of
\ti{complex} vector bundle over $X$, of rank $n$,
and we say the \ti{complex dimension} $\dim_\C X$ is
$n$.
\end{defn}

\begin{example}[Flat complex space] $\C^n$ has a canonical almost complex structure $I$, as follows. Each tangent space $T_p \C^n \simeq \C^n$ canonically; $I$ is multiplication by $\I$, thought of as an 
endomorphism of the underlying $2n$-dimensional real vector space.
Writing $z_i = x_i + \I y_i$, and taking the coordinate basis
$\{\partial_{x_1}, \partial_{x_2}, \dots, \partial_{x_n}, \partial_{y_1}, \partial_{y_2}, \dots, \partial_{y_n}\}$ for for $T_p \C^n$, $I$ is represented by the matrix
\begin{equation}
   I = \begin{pmatrix} {\bf 0}_{n \times n} & -{\bf 1}_{n \times n} \\ {\bf 1}_{n \times n} & {\bf 0}_{n \times n} \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
\end{example}

\begin{defn}[Holomorphic maps] \label{def:holomorphic-maps} If $(X,I_X)$ and $(Y,I_Y)$ are almost
complex manifolds, a \ti{holomorphic map} $\phi: X \to Y$
is one obeying
\begin{equation}
 I_Y \circ \de \phi = \de \phi \circ I_X.  
\end{equation}
\end{defn}

\begin{exercise} Show that, if both $(X,I_X)$ and $(Y,I_Y)$ are $\C$ with its canonical 
almost complex structure, \autoref{def:holomorphic-maps} becomes the standard
definition of holomorphic function (Cauchy-Riemann equations).
\end{exercise}

\begin{defn}[Complex structures] \label{def:complex-structures} An almost complex structure $I$ on $X$ is \ti{integrable}, 
or a \ti{complex structure}, if there is a covering of $X$ by open sets $U_\alpha$ with holomorphic diffeomorphisms $\phi_\alpha: U_\alpha \to V_\alpha \subset \C^n$ (where on $\C^n$ we take the
canonical almost complex structure.) A \ti{complex manifold} is an almost complex manifold $(X,I)$ with $I$ integrable.
\end{defn}

\begin{exercise} Show that \autoref{def:complex-structures} is equivalent to the usual definition of a complex manifold as a space
$X$ with a covering by charts $\phi_\alpha: U_\alpha \to \C^n$, where the transition maps are holomorphic (obey Cauchy-Riemann equations).
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}[Complex structure on $\C^n$] A tautological example is $X = \C^n$ itself with its 
canonical almost complex structure: just take a single open set $U = \C^n$, and $\phi: U \to \C^n$ to be the identity map. So the canonical almost complex structure on $\C^n$ is, tautologically, a
complex structure.
\end{example}

There are various equivalent ways of formulating the integrability condition. One which will be useful for us is:
\begin{prop}[Integrability means vanishing of Nijenhuis tensor] Define the \ti{Nijenhuis tensor} $N_I \in \Omega^0(\wedge^2 T^*X \otimes TX)$ as a map
$T^*X \otimes T^*X \to TX$ by
\begin{equation}
N_I(v,w) = [\tilde v,\tilde w] + I[\tilde v,I \tilde w] + I[I \tilde v, \tilde w] - [I\tilde v,I\tilde w],
\end{equation}
where $\tilde v$ and $\tilde w$ are any vector fields extending $v$, $w$.
Then $I$ is integrable if and only if
\begin{equation}
N_I = 0.  
\end{equation}
\end{prop}
\begin{pf} To show that integrability implies $N_I = 0$ is straightforward
by directly computing in a local coordinate chart. The other direction
is much harder --- it is the content of the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem.
\end{pf}

\subsection{Type decompositions}
Suppose $(X,I)$ is an almost complex manifold.
We have a decomposition
of $T_\C X = TX \otimes_\R \C$,
\begin{equation}
T_\C X = T^{1,0} X \oplus T^{0,1} X
  \end{equation}
where $T^{1,0} X$ and $T^{0,1} X$ are 
respectively the
$+\I$ and $-\I$ eigenspaces of $I$.
Both $TX$ and $T^{1,0}X$ are complex vector bundles 
of rank $n$; it is sometimes convenient to identify
them, by projection on the $(1,0)$ part.

\begin{exercise}
Show that this projection $\pi: TX \to T^{1,0}X$ indeed is an isomorphism 
of complex vector bundles. (This reduces essentially
to a question of linear algebra, concerning 
a vector space $V$ with complex structure $I$,
and its complexification $V_\C$.) If $X = \C$, 
what are $\pi(\partial_x)$ and $\pi(\partial_y)$?
\end{exercise}

There is also a dual decomposition
\begin{equation}
T^*_\C X = (T^*)^{1,0} X \oplus (T^*)^{0,1} X,
  \end{equation}
where $(T^*)^{1,0} X$ is the annihilator of
$T^{0,1} X$, and $(T^*)^{0,1} X$ is the annihilator of
$T^{1,0} X$.
This decomposition induces
\begin{equation}
\wedge^* T^*_\C X = \bigoplus_{p,q=0}^n \wedge^{p,q} T^* X , \qquad \Omega^*_\C X = \bigoplus_{p,q=0}^n \Omega^{p,q}(X).
\end{equation}

\begin{prop}[Integrability versus type decompositions] \label{prop:integrability}
Suppose $(X,I)$ is an almost complex manifold. The following are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item $I$ is integrable.
\item There is a decomposition
\begin{equation}
\de = \partial + \bar\partial, \quad \partial: \Omega^{p,q}(X) \to \Omega^{p+1,q}(X), \quad \bar\partial: \Omega^{p,q}(X) \to \Omega^{p,q+1}(X).
\end{equation}
\item The distribution $T^{0,1}X$ is integrable: if $v$, $w$ are 
sections of $T^{0,1}X$ then $[v,w]$ is also a section of $T^{0,1}X$.
\end{itemize}
\end{prop}

Complex conjugation is an $\R$-linear map
$\Omega^{p,q}(X) \to \Omega^{q,p}(X)$;
thus it maps $\Omega^{p,p}(X)$ to itself;
we let $\Omega_\R^{p,p}(X)$ denote the fixed subspace.

\subsection{Holomorphic vector bundles}

In this section $(X,I)$ is always a complex manifold.

\begin{defn}[Holomorphic vector bundle] A \ti{holomorphic vector bundle} over $X$ is a complex vector bundle $E$ over $X$, equipped with an operator
\begin{equation}
  \bar\partial_E :  \Omega^{p,q}(E) \to \Omega^{p,q+1}(E)
\end{equation}
obeying
\begin{equation}
  \bar\partial_E (\alpha \psi) = (\bar\partial \alpha) \psi + (-1)^{\abs{\alpha}} \alpha \wedge \bar\partial_E \psi \qquad \alpha \in \Omega^*(X), \quad \psi \in \Omega^0(E)
\end{equation}
and the integrability condition
\begin{equation}
  \bar\partial_E^2 = 0.
\end{equation}
\end{defn}

It is useful to think of $\bar\partial_E$ as a kind of 
partially-defined flat connection, which allows us to differentiate
only in the $(0,1)$ ``directions.''
The structure of holomorphic vector bundle is much 
more rigid than that of a merely complex vector bundle.
We emphasize that this structure makes sense only when $X$ is 
a complex manifold, while complex vector bundles make sense 
over any $X$.

\begin{prop}[Equivalence of definitions of holomorphic vector bundle] A structure of holomorphic vector bundle on $E$ is equivalent to a maximal atlas 
of preferred trivializations of $E$, such that
the transition maps 
$U_\alpha \cap U_\beta \to GL(r,\C)$ 
are holomorphic. 
\end{prop}
\begin{pf}

% \begin{example} The trivial bundle $X \times \C^r$
% carries a canonical holomorphic structure.
% \end{example}

\begin{example}[Tangent bundle as a holomorphic bundle] The tangent bundle $TX$ carries
a canonical structure of holomorphic vector bundle.
Indeed, the holomorphic charts $\phi_\alpha = (z_1, \dots, z_n)$ 
give rise to preferred trivializations corresponding 
to the bases $\{\partial_{z_1}, \dots, \partial_{z_n} \}$
for $T^{1,0} X \simeq TX$, and the transition 
maps are given by the Jacobian matrices 
$(\partial z'_i / \partial z_j)_{i,j=1}^n$, which are holomorphic.
% It can be described as follows: for each coordinate
% chart $\phi_\alpha: U \to \C^n$, we get an isomorphism
% $\de \phi_\alpha: TU \to T \C^n$, and under this 
% isomorphism $\bar\partial_{TX}$ is identified
% with the canonical holomorphic structure.

\begin{defn}[Connection compatible with holomorphic structure]
If $E$ is a holomorphic vector bundle over $X$,
a connection $D$ in $E$ is \ti{compatible with the
holomorphic structure} if, for all 
$\psi \in \Omega^0(E)$, the $(0,1)$ part of $D \psi$ 
is $\bar\partial_E \psi$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Chern connection]
If $E$ is a holomorphic vector bundle over $X$ with
a Hermitian metric $h$, the \ti{Chern connection} 
in $E$ is the unique connection which is 
$h$-unitary and compatible with the holomorphic
structure.
\end{defn}

\subsection{Hermitian and \kahler metrics}
Throughout this section $(X,I)$ is an almost complex manifold.

\begin{defn}[Hermitian metric on complex manifold] A Hermitian metric on 
$(X,I)$ is a Riemannian metric $g$ obeying
$$ g(v,w) = g(Iv,Iw). $$
Equivalently, with respect to the decomposition 
\begin{equation}
  \Sym^2 (T_\C X) = \Sym^{2,0} TX \oplus \Sym^{1,1} TX \oplus \Sym^{0,2} TX,
\end{equation}
we have $g \in \Sym^{1,1} TX$, i.e. $g$ is of ``type $(1,1)$.''
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Fundamental form] If $g$ is a Hermitian metric on $(X,I)$, 
the \ti{fundamental form} $\omega \in \Omega^{1,1}_\R(X)$
is
\begin{equation}
  \omega(v,w) = g(Iv,w).
\end{equation}
\end{defn}

\begin{exercise}If $g$ is a Hermitian metric on $(X,I)$ check that
\begin{equation}
  {\mathrm {vol}}_g = \frac{\omega^n}{n!}
\end{equation}
\end{exercise}

The term ``Hermitian'' might seem confusing here since $g$ is just 
an ordinary real-valued metric on the real vector bundle 
$TX$. The following should help:

\begin{exercise} \label{exc:hermitian-metric} 
If $g$ is a Hermitian metric on $(X,I)$,
verify that
\begin{equation}
  h = g - \I \omega
\end{equation}
defines a Hermitian metric
on the complex vector bundle $TX$.
(Our convention is that Hermitian metrics are
$\C$-linear in the \ti{first} slot.)
\end{exercise}

Let $\nabla$ denote the 
Levi-Civita connection on $TX$ induced
by the metric $g$.

\begin{defn}[\kahler metric] If $g$ is a Hermitian metric 
on $(X,I)$, we say $g$ is \ti{\kahler} if
\begin{equation}
  \nabla I = 0.
\end{equation}
Then $(X,g,I)$ is a \ti{\kahler manifold},
and $\omega$ is the \ti{\kahler form}.
\end{defn}

\begin{example}[Standard metric on $\C$ is \kahler] 
Take $X=\C$ with coordinate $z = x + \I y$, $I$ the standard complex structure,
and $g$ the standard Riemannian metric, $g = \de x^2 + \de y^2$.
Evidently $\nabla I = 0$, so this is a \kahler metric.
The \kahler form is
\begin{equation}
  \omega = \de x \wedge \de y = \frac{\I}{2} \de z \wedge \de \bar{z}.
\end{equation}
\end{example}

The \kahler property has various useful alternative 
characterizations:
% \begin{prop}[\kahler means covariant constancy of $I$]
% If $g$ is a Hermitian metric on $X$,
% $g$ is \kahler if and only if
% $\nabla I = 0$.
% \end{prop}

\begin{prop}[Characterizations of \kahler metrics] \label{cor:kahler-cc}
If $g$ is a Hermitian metric on $(X,I)$, with 
fundamental form $\omega$, then the following are
equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $g$ is \kahler,
  \item $\nabla I = 0$,
  \item $\nabla \omega = 0$,
  \item $I$ is integrable and $\nabla$ agrees with the Chern connection on $TX$,
  when we view $TX$ as a holomorphic vector bundle, with the induced Hermitian 
  metric $h$ of \autoref{exc:hermitian-metric},
  \item $I$ is integrable and $\de \omega = 0$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{pf} As we defined \kahler we have 
automatically $(1) \Leftrightarrow (2)$. 
Using $\nabla g = 0$ we easily obtain $(2) \Leftrightarrow (3)$.
So all of $(1)$-$(3)$ are equivalent.

Now we consider $(4)$.
To show $(2)$ implies integrability of $I$,
note that for $v,w$ sections of $T^{0,1} X$ we have
(using the torsion-free property of $\nabla$ and
$\nabla I = 0$)
\begin{equation}
  I[v,w] = I(\nabla_v w - \nabla_w v) = \nabla_v(Iw) - \nabla_w(Iv) = -\I (\nabla_v w - \nabla_w v) = -\I [v,w],
\end{equation}
so by \autoref{prop:integrability} $I$ is
integrable. Also $(2)$ implies that
for $v \in TX$ and $w$ a section of $T^{1,0} X$
we have $I (\nabla_v w) = \nabla_v (Iw) = \I \nabla_v w$,
so that $\nabla_v w$ is also a section of $T^{1,0} X$;
this means $\nabla$ is compatible with the holomorphic
structure.
Finally $(2)+(3)$ implies $\nabla h = 0$.
So we have shown that $(2) \Rightarrow (4)$.
Conversely, we have easily $(4) \Rightarrow (3)$,
since $\omega$ is the imaginary part of $h$.
Thus, all of $(1)$-$(4)$ are equivalent.

Finally we consider $(5)$. We already showed that
$(2)$ implies integrability of $I$. Also
$(3)$ immediately implies $\de \omega = 0$.
Thus we have $(2)+(3) \Rightarrow (5)$.
All that remains is to see that $(5) \Rightarrow (4)$,
which is the most interesting part. This amounts to verifying
that the Chern connection is torsion-free (then it will have
to agree with $\nabla$, since $\nabla$ is the unique connection
in $TX$ which is torsion-free and has $\nabla g = 0$.) \fixme{...}
\end{pf}




In particular \autoref{cor:kahler-cc} implies that any complex 
submanifold of a \kahler manifold is again \kahler. Combining this 
with the fact that $\C\PP^n$ admits a \kahler metric
(Fubini-Study), we obtain a huge supply of examples.

Finally we quickly recall the notion of special holonomy. Recall that for any Riemannian metric $g$ the parallel transport of Levi-Civita preserves $g$, so that 
for any $p \in X$ the holonomy group $Hol_\nabla(p) \subset GL(T_p X)$ 
is contained in the subgroup $O(g(p)) \simeq O(2n)$.
For a \kahler metric, \autoref{cor:kahler-cc} says
the parallel transport of Levi-Civita preserves the Hermitian metric
$h$ on the complex vector bundle $TX$. Thus, for any $p \in X$, the holonomy group
$Hol_\nabla(p) \subset GL(T_p X)$ is contained in the smaller group $U(h(p)) \simeq U(n)$.
Conversely, if $Hol_\nabla(p)$ is contained in some subgroup 
isomorphic to $U(n)$ then it preserves some $h$, from 
which one can prove:

\begin{prop}[Special holonomy of \kahler manifolds] Given any Riemannian metric $g$ on a manifold $M$ of dimension $2n$, $g$ is a \kahler metric 
(for some complex structure $I$ on $M$) if and only if
the holonomy group at a point is contained in
a subgroup isomorphic to $U(n)$.
\end{prop}


\section{Hyperk\"ahler manifolds}

Useful (and inspiring) references are \cite{MR88f:53087,Hitchin-hk,MR1798605,boalch-notes}.

\subsection{Basic definitions}

\begin{defn}[\Hk manifold] A \ti{\hk manifold} is 
a tuple $(X,g,I_1,I_2,I_3)$, where $(X,g)$ is a Riemannian 
manifold equipped with three complex 
structures $I_i$ obeying $I_1 I_2 = I_3$,
such that $(X,g,I_i)$ is \kahler for $i=1,2,3$.
\end{defn}

It is crucial that we require the \ti{single} metric
$g$ to be \kahler for \ti{all} of the $I_i$:
this is a very strong condition!
We denote the three corresponding
\kahler forms $\omega_i$.
Sometimes it is convenient to use instead the
notation $(I_1,I_2,I_3) = (I,J,K)$
and $(\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3) = (\omega_I,\omega_J,\omega_K)$.

\begin{exercise} Show that the relations $I_1 I_2 = I_3$ and $I_1^2 = I_2^2 = I_3^2 = -1$ are equivalent to the full set of quaternion relations
\begin{gather}
  I_1 I_2 = I_3, \quad I_2 I_1 = - I_3, \\
  I_2 I_3 = I_1, \quad I_3 I_2 = - I_1, \\
  I_3 I_1 = I_2, \quad I_1 I_3 = - I_2, \\
  I_1^2 = I_2^2 = I_3^2 = -1.
\end{gather}
\end{exercise}

\begin{defn}[Holomorphic symplectic form] If $(X,I)$ is a complex manifold, 
$\Omega \in \Omega^{2,0}(X)$ is a \ti{holomorphic
symplectic form} if $\de \Omega = 0$
and $\Omega$ is nondegenerate in the holomorphic sense, i.e. it induces
an isomorphism $T^{1,0}X \to (T^{1,0} X)^*$.
\end{defn}
(Note that this definitely does \ti{not} mean that $\Omega$ is nondegenerate on the whole $T_\C X$. Indeed, since $\Omega$ is 
of type $(2,0)$ its contraction with any $v \in T^{0,1} X$ vanishes.)

\begin{prop}[\Hk manifolds are holomorphic symplectic] \label{prop:hyperkahler-is-hol-symplectic}
If $X$ is \hk then $\Omega_1 = \omega_2 + \I \omega_3$ is a \ti{holomorphic symplectic form} with respect to structure $I_1$ (and similarly with the indices 
$1,2,3$ cyclically permuted.)
\end{prop}
\begin{pf} 
\begin{align}
    \Omega_1(v,w) &= \omega_2(v,w) + \I \omega_3(v,w) \\
    &= g(I_2 v,w) + \I g(I_3 v,w)
\end{align}
Thus
\begin{align}
    \Omega_1(I_1 v,w) &= g(I_2 I_1 v, w) + \I g(I_3 I_1 v,w) \\
    &= -g(I_3 v, w) + \I g(I_2 v, w) \\
    &= \I \Omega_1(v,w)
\end{align}
and similarly
\begin{equation}
 \Omega_1(v,I_1 w) = \I \Omega_1(v,w). 
\end{equation}
It follows that $\Omega_1$ is of type $(2,0)$ for $I_1$,
$\Omega_1 \in \Omega^{2,0}_{I_1}(X)$.
The nondegeneracy follows from the nondegeneracy for the $\omega_i$: namely, for any $v \in T^{1,0}_{I_1} X$,
\begin{equation}
  \Omega_1(v,\cdot) = 0 \implies \Omega_1(v+\bar{v}, \cdot) = 0 \implies \omega_2(v + \bar{v}, \cdot) = 0 \implies v + \bar{v} = 0 \implies v = 0.
\end{equation}
The remaining claims are obtained by cyclic permutations.
\end{pf}

\begin{cor}[\Hk manifolds have dimension $4n$] If $X$ is \hk then $\dim_\R X$ is a multiple of $4$.
\end{cor}
\begin{pf} The holomorphic symplectic form $\Omega_1$ restricts to a nondegenerate
form on each fiber of the complex vector bundle $T^{1,0}_{I_1} X$.
Using \autoref{prop:standard-nondegenerate-2-form}, it follows
that $T^{1,0}_{I_1} X$ has even complex dimension.
\end{pf}

\begin{prop}[Holomorphic symplectic form determines complex structure] \label{prop:hol-symp-to-complex}
Suppose $X$ is a manifold with $\dim_\R X = 2n$, 
with $\Omega \in \Omega^2_\C(X)$, such that $\de \Omega = 0$ and
\begin{equation}
 T_\C X = \ker \Omega \oplus \ker \overline\Omega. 
\end{equation}
Then there is a 
unique complex structure $I$ on $X$, for which $\Omega$
is a holomorphic symplectic form.
\end{prop}
\begin{pf} We define a complex-linear operator 
$I_\C$ on $T_\C X$ to act by $-\I$ on
$\ker \Omega$, and by $+\I$ on $\ker \overline\Omega$.
This $I_\C$ obeys $I_\C v = \overline{I_\C \bar{v}}$, so it is the 
complexification of a real-linear operator $I$ on $TX$,
which gives an almost complex structure.
The integrability of $I$ is equivalent to requiring
that $T^{0,1} X = \ker \Omega$ is an integrable distribution,
i.e. that if $v,w$ are sections of $\ker \Omega$ then $[v,w]$
is also a section of $\ker \Omega$.
This follows from $\de \Omega = 0$ and the covariant formula
for $\de$: for any third vector field $y$ we have
\begin{equation}
  \de \Omega(v,w,y) = v \Omega(w,y) + w \Omega(y,v) + y \Omega(v,w)
  - \Omega([v,w],y) - \Omega([y,v],w) - \Omega([w,y],v)
\end{equation}
and now all terms vanish except the one we want:
\begin{equation}
  0 = -\Omega([v,w],y)
\end{equation}
so $[v,w]$ is a section of $\ker \Omega$ as desired.

\end{pf}

\begin{prop}[Explicit formula for the complex structures on a 
\hk manifold in terms of $\omega_i$]
If $X$ is \hk then
\begin{equation}
I_1 = \omega_3^{-1} \omega_2  
\end{equation}
and cyclic permutations.
(What this formula really means: view $\omega_2$ as a map $TX \to T^* X$
namely $v \mapsto \omega_2(v,\cdot)$,
and $\omega_3^{-1}$ as a map $T^* X \to TX$
namely $\omega_3(v,\cdot) \mapsto v$; then the composition
$\omega_3^{-1} \omega_2: TX \to TX$ is $I_1$.)
\end{prop}
\begin{pf}
What we have to check is that $\omega_3(I_1 v,\cdot) = \omega_2(v,\cdot)$.
But 
\begin{equation}
 \omega_3(I_1 v,\cdot) = g(I_3 I_1 v,\cdot) = g(I_2 v, \cdot) = \omega_2(v,\cdot) 
\end{equation}
as desired.
\end{pf}

\begin{cor}[The $\omega_i$ determine the \hk metric]
If $X$ is \hk then
\begin{equation}
g = -\omega_1 \omega_3^{-1} \omega_2  
\end{equation}
and cyclic permutations.
(Here similarly we view $g$ as a map $TX \to T^*X$,
namely $v \mapsto g(v,\cdot)$.)
\end{cor}

\begin{prop}[Condition for forms $\omega_i$ to give a \hk metric] \label{prop:omega-hk-condition}
Suppose $X$ is a smooth manifold with symplectic forms 
$\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3$, obeying the condition that
\begin{equation}
-\omega_1 \omega_3^{-1} \omega_2 = -\omega_2 \omega_1^{-1} \omega_3 = -\omega_3 \omega_2^{-1} \omega_1,
\end{equation}
and that this quantity, $g$, 
is \ti{positive definite} as a symmetric bilinear form.
Then $g$ is a \hk metric on $X$,
with $\omega_i$ the associated \kahler forms.
\end{prop}
\begin{pf} \fixme{...}
\end{pf}

\begin{exercise}
Suppose $(X,g,I_1,I_2,I_3)$ is a \hk manifold. Fix any $\vec s = (s_1,s_2,s_3) \in S^2 \subset \R^3$, and set
\begin{equation}
  I_{\vec s} = \sum_{i=1}^3 s_i I_i, \qquad \omega_{\vec s} = \sum_{i=1}^3 s_i \omega_i.
\end{equation}
Show that $(X,I_{\vec s},g)$ is a \kahler manifold,
with \kahler form $\omega_{\vec s}$.
\end{exercise}
In other words, a \hk metric is \kahler for a whole 
$S^2$ of complex structures, not only three of them.
We can think of this $S^2$ as the
set of norm-$1$ imaginary quaternions.
Specifying $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$ is equivalent to 
specifying the whole collection of $I_{\vec s}$.

Note that the antipodal map acts in a simple way:
$I_{-\vec s} = - I_{\vec s}$, the opposite
complex structure of $I_{\vec s}$ --- i.e. 
the antipodal map exchanges holomorphic and antiholomorphic.

\begin{exercise}
Given a Riemannian manifold $(X,g)$ and 
a \hk structure thereon, specified by complex structures
$I_{\vec s}$, show that we get another
\hk structure by choosing an element $T \in SO(3)$
and defining 
\begin{equation}
I'_{\vec s} = I_{T \vec s}.
\end{equation}
Thus $SO(3)$ naturally acts on the set of
\hk manifolds.
\end{exercise}


\subsection{First examples}

\begin{example}[Flat quaternionic space] \label{exa:R4}
Being a real vector space, $\bbH$ is
a manifold of real dimension $4$.
If we identify $T_p \bbH \simeq \bbH$ in the obvious way,
the quaternion norm $\norm{q}^2 = q \bar{q}$
induces a metric $g$ on $\bbH$.
The operations of left-multiplication by $\I$, $\J$ and $\K$
give complex structures $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$ on $\bbH$,
obeying the quaternion algebra.
Evidently these are all covariantly constant, so
$g$ is \kahler for all three of these complex
structures, and thus $\bbH$ is \hk.

To introduce coordinates we
identify $\bbH$ with $\R^4$
via the map
\begin{equation}
  x_0 + x_1 \I + x_2 \J + x_3 \K \mapsto (x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3).
\end{equation}

Then the symplectic forms are
\begin{align}
  \omega_1 &= \de x_0 \wedge \de x_1 + \de x_2 \wedge \de x_3, \\
  \omega_2 &= \de x_0 \wedge \de x_2 + \de x_3 \wedge \de x_1, \\
  \omega_3 &= \de x_0 \wedge \de x_3 + \de x_1 \wedge \de x_2,
\end{align}
or more uniformly
\begin{equation} \label{eq:symplectic-forms-R4}
  \omega_i = \de x_0 \wedge \de x_i + \star \de x_i
\end{equation}
where $\star$ denotes the Hodge star of $\R^3$ (with its 
standard orientation), not $\R^4$.
The holomorphic symplectic form is
\begin{equation}
  \Omega_1 = \omega_2 + \I \omega_3 = \de w_1 \wedge \de z_1, \qquad w_1 = x_0 + \I x_1, \qquad z_1 = x_2 + \I x_3.
\end{equation}
$w_1$ and $z_1$ are complex coordinates with respect to $I_1$.
Thus, in structure $I_1$, $\bbH$ is biholomorphic to $\C^2$.
Similarly we can write
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Omega-i-R4}
  \Omega_i = \omega_{i+1} + \I \omega_{i+2} = \de w_i \wedge \de z_i, \qquad w_i = x_0 + \I x_i, \qquad z_i = x_{i+1} + \I x_{i+2}
\end{equation}
(where we adopt the convention $x_{i+3} = x_i$.)

All this generalizes in a straightforward way to $\bbH^n$ 
or better, an affine space modeled on $\bbH^n$, or even 
better, an affine space modeled on a quaternionic vector space.
\end{example}



\begin{exercise} \label{exc:flat-space-computing}
Verify the explicit formulas for the symplectic forms
$\omega_i$ on $\bbH$, and write a formula for $\omega_{\vec s}$.
\end{exercise}

$\bbH$ has a lot of symmetry. For example, $\bbH$ acts 
on itself by translations preserving the \hk structure.
Also the group $O(4)$ acts on $\bbH$ by isometries, but 
these do \ti{not} generally preserve the \hk structure.
However, we do have the following. The 
unit sphere in ${\mathbb H}$ is a Lie group,
which happens to be isomorphic to $SU(2)$.\footnote{The isomorphism
can be given explicitly by the formula
\begin{equation}
  x_0 + x_1 \I + x_2 \J + x_3 \K \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} x_0+x_1\I & x_2+x_3\I \\ -x_2+x_3\I & x_0-x_1\I \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
but we will not need to use this anywhere.}
Thus we have an action of $SU(2) \times SU(2)$ 
on ${\mathbb H}$ by
\begin{equation}
  (q, q') \cdot x = q x q'^{-1}.
\end{equation}
This gives a map $SU(2) \times SU(2) \to SO(4)$.
Said otherwise, $O(4)$ has two canonical $SU(2)$ subgroups,
which we call $SU(2)_L$ and $SU(2)_R$ (for ``left'' and ``right.'')
(Incidentally, this map has kernel $\{(1,1),(-1,-1)\} \simeq \Z_2$, 
thus gives an isomorphism $SO(4) \simeq (SU(2) \times SU(2)) / \Z_2$.)

\begin{exercise} \label{exc:su2r-action}
Show that $SU(2)_R$ acts on $\bbH$ by \ti{triholomorphic} 
isometries, i.e. isometries which are holomorphic for
all of $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{exc:su2l-action}
Show that the action of $T \in SU(2)_L$ on $\bbH$ has
\begin{equation}
  T^* I_{\vec s} = I_{T \vec s}
\end{equation}
On the right side, by $T \vec s$ we mean the \ti{conjugation}
action of the unit quaternion $T$ on the sphere of norm-$1$
imaginary quaternions, $\vec s \mapsto T^{-1} {\vec s} T$ 
(which gives the standard double-covering $SU(2) \to SO(3)$.)
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Show that in any complex structure
$I_{\vec s}$, $\bbH$ is biholomorphic
to $\C^2$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}[Quotients of $\bbH$] \label{exa:H-quotients}
It follows from \autoref{exc:su2r-action} that, if we choose a subgroup
$\Gamma \subset SU(2)_R$, the quotient
$\bbH / \Gamma$ is a \hk orbifold: in particular, it
carries a natural \hk structure 
on the locus where it is a manifold. For example,
if $\Gamma$ is a discrete subgroup, it acts
freely away from the origin, so
\begin{equation}
X_\Gamma^\circ = (\bbH \setminus \{0\}) / \Gamma  
\end{equation}
is a \hk manifold.
However, this \hk manifold is \ti{incomplete},
since the origin is at finite distance.
\end{example}

\insfig{higgs-bundles-4}{0.65}

\begin{example}[$\R^3 \times S^1$] \label{exa:R3S1}
Since translations preserve the \hk structure, we can divide $\bbH$
out by $\Z$ acting by translations 
\begin{equation}
 x_0 \to x_0 + 2 \pi n 
\end{equation}
to get another \hk manifold,
\begin{equation}
 X = \bbH / \Z \simeq \R^3 \times S^1.
\end{equation}
In structure $I_1$ we have
\begin{equation}
  \Omega_1 = -\I \frac{\de \cX_1}{\cX_1} \wedge \de z_1, \qquad \cX_1 = \exp(\I(x_0 + \I x_1)), \qquad z_1 = x_2 + \I x_3 
\end{equation}
The functions $(z_1,\cX_1)$ make $(X,I_1)$ 
biholomorphic to $\C \times \C^\times$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Show that $SO(3)$ acts by isometries on $X = \bbH / \Z$,
with
\begin{equation}
  T^* I_{\vec s} = I_{T \vec s}.
\end{equation}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Show that for any $\vec s$, $X = \bbH / \Z$ with complex structure
$I_{\vec s}$ is biholomorphic to $\C \times \C^\times$.
\end{exercise}

Crudely speaking, the different complex structures 
$I_{\vec s}$ correspond to different ways of picking which 
direction in $\R^3$ will get 
paired up with the circle direction to make a $\C^\times$.

\begin{example}[Incomplete Gibbons-Hawking spaces] \label{exa:incomplete-gibbons-hawking}
Now we generalize from $\R^3 \times S^1$ to a more general
\hk space with $U(1)$ action, i.e. we consider a principal
$U(1)$ bundle.

Fix some open set $U \subset \R^3$ and
let $V: U \to \R_{>0}$ be a positive harmonic function.\footnote{Our
conventions for the Laplace operator on $\Omega^0(\R^3)$ are:
$\Delta f = \de \star \de f = \sum_i \partial_i^2 f \, \de \vol$.}
Then $\Delta V = \de \star \de V = 0$, so if we write
\begin{equation}
  F = -2 \pi \star \de V
\end{equation}
then we have $\de F = 0$. 

Fix a principal $U(1)$ bundle $X$ over $U$, carrying a connection
$\Theta$ whose curvature is $F$.
(Such an $X$ exists if and only if $[F/2\pi]$ lies in 
the image of $H^2(U,\Z) \to H^2(U,\R)$.) 
Globally this means a 1-form $\Theta$ on $X$
such that $\de \Theta = F$ (more precisely on the RHS we have
the pullback of $F$ to $X$) and $\Theta \cdot \partial_\chi = 1$,
where $\partial_\chi$ denotes the vector field generating
the $U(1)$ action.
If we choose a local
trivialization of the $U(1)$-bundle $X$ over a patch
$U_\alpha \subset U$, with local 
fiber coordinate $\chi_{\alpha} \in \R / 2 \pi \Z$, then $\Theta$ 
is locally of the form
\begin{equation}
 \Theta = A_\alpha + \de \chi_{\alpha} 
\end{equation}
with $A_\alpha \in \Omega^1(U_\alpha)$, $\de A_\alpha = F$.
\newcommand{\tTheta}{\tilde\Theta}
For convenience write $\tTheta = \Theta / 2\pi$.

We introduce three symplectic forms on $X$,
generalizing \eqref{eq:symplectic-forms-R4}:
\begin{equation}
  \omega_i = \tTheta \wedge \de x_i + V \star \de x_i.
\end{equation}
To check that these are indeed closed,
\begin{equation}
  \de \omega_i = - \star \de V \wedge \de x_i + \de V \wedge \star \de x_i = 0
\end{equation}
(the last equality because all of these forms are pulled back
from $\R^3$, and on $\R^3$ we always have $\star \alpha \wedge \beta = \alpha \wedge \star \beta$ for 1-forms $\alpha, \beta$.)

Then define
\begin{align}
  \Omega_1 &= \omega_2 + \I \omega_3 \\
  &= \tTheta \wedge \de z_1 +  V \star \de(x_2 + \I x_3)\\
  &= \tTheta \wedge \de z_1 +  V (\de x_3 \wedge \de x_1 + \I \de x_1 \wedge \de x_2)\\
  &= \tTheta \wedge \de z_1 + \I V \de x_1 \wedge \de z_1 \\
  &= V \alpha_1 \wedge \de z_1
\end{align}
where we introduced
\begin{equation} \label{eq:hol-forms-GH}
  z_1 = x_2 + \I x_3, \qquad 
  \alpha_1 = V^{-1} \tTheta + \I \de x_1.
\end{equation}
Then $\ker \Omega_1$ is spanned by $\hat\partial_2 + \I \hat\partial_3$
and $2 \pi V \partial_\chi + \I \hat\partial_1$, where $\partial_\chi$ 
is the globally defined generator of the $U(1)$ action 
(shifting $\chi$),  and $\hat \partial_i$ means
the parallel lift of $\partial_i$ from $\R^3$ to $X$, i.e. the lift
obeying $\Theta \cdot \hat\partial_1 = 0$. Thus
by \autoref{prop:hol-symp-to-complex}, $\Omega_1$ 
determines a complex structure $I_1$ on $X$, which acts
by $+\I$ on $\de z_1$ and $\alpha_1$.
In this structure, $\de z_1$ is of type $(1,0)$, so
$z_1$ is a holomorphic map,
\begin{equation}
  z_1: X \to \C.
\end{equation}

Morally this map makes $X$ into something like 
a $\C^\times$-bundle over a patch of $\C$ (generalizing
the $\C\times\C^\times$ which we got in \autoref{exa:R3S1}).
It is not quite a $\C^\times$-bundle in general
(since $U$ was an arbitrary open subset of $\R^3$), 
but it does at least have 
a holomorphic vector field tangent to the fibers,
$\partial_\chi - \I V^{-1} \hat \partial_1$.

Similarly we have
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Omega-i-GH}
  \Omega_i = V \alpha_i \wedge \de z_i
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Omega-i-GH-2}
  z_i = x_{i+1} + \I x_{i+2}, \qquad \alpha_i = V^{-1} \tTheta + \I \de x_i
\end{equation}
and we can use this to define complex structures $I_2$, $I_3$.
Just as for $\R^3 \times S^1$ these obey the quaternion
relation $I_1 I_2 = I_3$ --- we could check this directly, 
or just note that pointwise \eqref{eq:Omega-i-GH}-\eqref{eq:Omega-i-GH-2}
are isomorphic to \eqref{eq:Omega-i-R4}
(take $\de x_i \to \sqrt{V} \de x_i$ and $\de x_0 \to \tTheta / \sqrt{V}$),
and the $\Omega_i$ determine the $I_i$ by pointwise calculations,
so they must obey the same relations they obeyed on $\R^4$.

Now we compute $g$ from $I_1$ and $\omega_1$:
\begin{equation}
  \omega_1 = V \re \alpha_1 \wedge \im \alpha_1 + V \re \de z_1 \wedge \im \de z_1
\end{equation}
which gives
\begin{align}
  g &= V ((\re \alpha_1)^2 + (\im \alpha_1)^2) + V ((\re \de z_1)^2 + (\im \de z_1)^2) \\
  &= V (V^{-2} \tTheta^2 + \de x_1^2) + V (\de x_2^2 + \de x_3^2) \\
  &= V \norm{\de x}^2 + V^{-1} \tTheta^2
\end{align}
% Note that the explicit index $1$ has disappeared from this formula;
% if we had computed $g$ from $I_2$ and $\omega_2$, or
% from $I_3$ and $\omega_3$, we would get the same result.
Thus the metric on $X$ given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gibbons-hawking-metric}
  g = V \norm{\de x}^2 + V^{-1} \tTheta^2
\end{equation}
is \hk, with \kahler forms $\omega_i$.

The principal $U(1)$ action on $X$ is by isometries preserving
the \hk structure (this is clear since nothing in $\omega_i$
depends on the fiber coordinates).
\end{example}

\begin{exercise} \label{exc:preimages-of-lines} 
Let $L$ be a line in $U$, oriented 
in the direction $\vec s = (1,0,0)$. 
Show that $\pi^{-1}(L)$ is a complex submanifold of $X$
in the complex structure $I_1$. (Hint: it's sufficient
to show that the holomorphic symplectic form $\Omega_1$ vanishes
along this submanifold --- why?) If $U = \R^3$ and $V=1$,
describe this complex submanifold explicitly in complex coordinates. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}[$\R^4 \setminus \{ 0 \}$ as an incomplete Gibbons-Hawking space] \label{exa:gibbons-hawking-R4}
Consider \autoref{exa:incomplete-gibbons-hawking} with
$U = \R^3 \setminus \{0\}$. In spherical coordinates
$(r,\theta,\varphi)$ take\footnote{Our conventions
for spherical coordinates are:
\begin{align}
x_1 &= r \cos \theta, \\
x_2 &= r \sin \theta \cos \phi, \\
x_3 &= r \sin \theta \sin \phi.
\end{align}
}
\begin{equation}
 V(x) = \frac{1}{4\pi r}.
\end{equation}
Then we have 
\begin{equation}
 F = \half \sin \theta \, \de \theta \wedge \de \varphi 
\end{equation}
which has $\int_{S^2} \frac{F}{2\pi} = 1$ and thus obeys our
quantization condition, so that there exists a circle bundle
$X \to U$ with this curvature. The total space of such a
circle bundle over $S^2$ is the Hopf fibration $S^3 \to S^2$.

$X$ thus doesn't extend as a $U(1)$ bundle
over the point $x = 0$.
Nevertheless it \ti{does} extend as a \hk manifold.
Indeed, near $0$ the circle fibers of $X$ are shrinking to zero
length, and it is possible to add
a single point over $0$, in such a way 
that the total space is a \hk manifold with non-free 
$U(1)$ action, and the quotient is $\R^3$.
To see this explicitly, let's fix a trivialization away 
from $\theta = \pi$, with respect to 
which $\Theta = A + \de \chi$,
\begin{equation}
  A = \half(1 - \cos \theta) \, \de \varphi.
\end{equation}

Now we have 
\begin{align}
  g &= \frac{1}{4 \pi r} (\de r^2 + r^2 \de \theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2 \theta \de \varphi^2) + \frac{r}{\pi} \left(\half (1-\cos \theta) \de \varphi + \de \chi\right)^2 \\
%  &= \frac{1}{4 \pi r} \de r^2 + \frac{r}{4 \pi} (\de \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \de \varphi^2 + ((1 - \cos \theta) \de \varphi + 2 \de \chi)^2) \\
  &= \frac{1}{4 \pi r} \de r^2 + \frac{r}{\pi} \left(\qtr \de \theta^2 + \half(1-\cos\theta) \de \varphi^2 + \de \chi^2 + (1-\cos \theta) \de \varphi \de \chi\right).
\end{align}
Now the surprise is that the second part is just the round 
metric on $S^3$ with radius $\rho = \sqrt{r/\pi}$, 
and the whole $g$ is isometric to 
the Euclidean metric on $\R^4 \setminus \{0\}$.
To see this explicitly take
\begin{align}
  y_0 &= \sqrt{r/\pi} \sin(\theta/2) \cos\left(\varphi + \chi\right), \\
  y_1 &= \sqrt{r/\pi} \sin(\theta/2) \sin\left(\varphi + \chi\right), \\
  y_2 &= \sqrt{r/\pi} \cos(\theta/2) \cos\left(-\chi\right), \\
  y_3 &= \sqrt{r/\pi} \cos(\theta/2) \sin\left(-\chi\right),
\end{align}
and then compute directly that
\begin{equation}
  g = \sum_{i=0}^3 \de y_i^2.
\end{equation}
\end{example}

\begin{exercise} \label{exc:gibbons-hawking-R4}
Show that the \hk structure on $X$ in
\autoref{exa:gibbons-hawking-R4} matches the standard one
in $\R^4 \setminus \{0\}$, given in \autoref{exa:R4}.
This means that $X$ can be extended to a 
complete \hk manifold $\bar X$, on which $U(1)$ acts 
by isometries with a single fixed point,
and $\bar X / U(1) = \R^3$. In other words, starting 
from $X$ we can ``fill in the missing fiber over $0$''
in a smooth \hk way, and the resulting \hk manifold
is isomorphic to $\R^4$ with its standard \hk structure.
\fixme{I only checked $\omega_1$ comes out right}
\end{exercise}

In particular, complex structure $I_1$ on $X$ has
holomorphic coordinates $w_1 = y_0 + \I y_1$ and $z_1 = y_2 + \I y_3$.
Thus the loci $z_1 = 0$ and $w_1 = 0$ are complex submanifolds of
$I_1$, intersecting at a single point.
These correspond to $\theta = 0$ and $\theta = \pi$, 
i.e. the preimages in $X$ of the two half-lines $x_2 = x_3 = 0$, $\pm x_1 \ge 0$.
(From Exercise \ref{exc:preimages-of-lines} we already knew that
the preimage of the half-line is a complex manifold, \ti{except} at the 
point over $x = 0$. The discussion above shows that it actually extends
to an honest complex manifold even over $x=0$.)

\insfig{higgs-bundles-6}{0.9}

There is a more conceptual way of arriving at \autoref{exa:gibbons-hawking-R4}:

\begin{exercise}
Consider again the standard \hk structure on $\R^4$ 
(\autoref{exa:R4}), which is acted on by $SU(2)_R$.
Show that there is a subgroup $U(1) \subset SU(2)_R$ which acts
by $(w_1,z_1) \to (e^{-\I \alpha} w_1, e^{\I\alpha} z_1)$.
Thus this action preserves the \hk structure.
Moreover show that this action admits moment maps 
$\mu_i: \R^4 \to \fu(1)^*$ with 
respect to all of the $\omega_i$.
If we identify $\fu(1) \simeq \R$, we obtain a map $\vec\mu: \R^4 \to \R^3$ given by
$(\mu_1, \mu_2, \mu_3)$. Show that the image of $\vec\mu$ is the complement of a 
point in $\R^3$; by shifting each $\mu_i$ by a constant we can arrange
that this point is $0 \in \R^3$. Then show that $\vec\mu$ realizes
$\R^4 \setminus \{0\}$ as principal $U(1)$ bundle over $\R^3 \setminus \{0\}$,
and that the metric is of the form in \autoref{exa:gibbons-hawking-R4}.
(Hint: at some points it is convenient to consider the complex combination 
$\mu_2 + \I \mu_3$, which is a moment map for the holomorphic symplectic
form $\Omega_1$.)
\end{exercise}

% This was also true of $\bbH$ of course 
% (\autoref{exc:flat-space-computing}); nevertheless, Taub-NUT space
% and $\bbH$ are definitely not the same \hk manifold!
% Thus there is more information in the \hk structure than
% in the set of complex manifolds one obtains by specializing.

\begin{example}[$(\R^4 / \Z_k) \setminus \{0\}$ as an incomplete Gibbons-Hawking space]
\label{exa:gibbons-hawking-R4Zk}
We can modify \autoref{exa:gibbons-hawking-R4} by taking some
integer $k>0$ and setting
\begin{equation}
  V = \frac{k}{4 \pi r}.
\end{equation}
Then the metric \eqref{eq:gibbons-hawking-metric} (divided by $k$)
matches with that of \autoref{exa:gibbons-hawking-R4} except that
the circumference of the circle fibers is shorter by a factor of $k$.
In other words, this metric is obtained by dividing
out the metric of $\R^4 / \{ 0 \}$ by a subgroup 
$\Z_k \subset U(1)$. In turn this $U(1) \subset SU(2)_R$, so this is a special case of the quotients
described in \autoref{exa:H-quotients}. Unlike the case $k=1$, here we \ti{cannot}
fill in the missing point to make a smooth manifold (if we could, we would have a 
point whose link is the lens space $S^3 / \Z_k$.)
\end{example}

Finally we are ready to use this technology to 
produce some really interesting complete \hk spaces.
There are no 
nonconstant positive harmonic functions on the full $\R^3$.\footnote{
This is trickier than I thought, but there is a proof 
at \tt\href{http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/561818}{http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/561818}.
}
Thus \autoref{exa:incomplete-gibbons-hawking} does not give
\hk metrics fibered over the full $\R^3$.
However we can do better:

\begin{example}[Gibbons-Hawking spaces] \label{exa:gibbons-hawking}
Extending \autoref{exa:incomplete-gibbons-hawking}
and \autoref{exa:gibbons-hawking-R4},
let us fix $U \subset \R^3$, 
distinct points $x_1, \dots, x_k$ in $U$,
and a function $V$ on $U$ with\footnote{On the RHS $\delta$ means
the ``Dirac delta function'' on $\R^3$, 
which should be understood
as a distributional 3-form; thus this 
equality is understood in the sense 
of distributions; it won't be important for our purpose to 
know exactly what it means, since we will deal only with
some very concrete examples, but if you are interested,
one source is Chapter 6 of \cite{MR1817225}.}
\begin{equation}
  \Delta V = - \sum_{i=1}^n \delta(x - x_i).
\end{equation}
Then consider a $U(1)$-bundle $X$ over $U \setminus \{x_i\}$ 
with \hk structure as in \autoref{exa:incomplete-gibbons-hawking}.
Consider a small $S^2$ around $x_i$:
\begin{equation}
  \int_{S^2} \frac{F}{2\pi} = -\int_{S^2} \star \de V = -\int_{B^3} \de \star \de V = \int_{B^3} \delta(x - x_i) = 1
\end{equation}
so the $U(1)$ bundle $X$ restricted to this $S^2$ has 
degree $1$. Thus, $X$ doesn't extend as a $U(1)$ bundle
over the point $x_i$.

Nevertheless it \ti{does} extend as a \hk manifold.
Indeed, near $x_i$ we have
\begin{equation}
V = \frac{1}{4\pi\norm{x - x_i}} + \text{regular},
\end{equation}
so the circle fibers of $X$ are shrinking to zero
length just as in \autoref{exa:gibbons-hawking-R4}.
It is possible to add a single point over each $x_i$
to get a new space $\bar X$, which is a \hk manifold with non-free 
$U(1)$ action, with $\bar X / U(1) = U$.
% This follows from the computation 
% we have already done in \autoref{exa:gibbons-hawking-R4}.
Indeed, choosing the coordinate $x' = x - x_i$,
a neighborhood $W$ of $x' = 0$ in $X$ can be identified as a 
principal $U(1)$-bundle with a neighborhood of $x = 0$
in \autoref{exa:gibbons-hawking-R4}. We have
$V = V_0 + \delta V$ and $\Theta = \Theta_0 + \delta \Theta$,
where $V_0$ and $\Theta_0$ are as in \autoref{exa:gibbons-hawking-R4},
$\delta V$ is a smooth (harmonic) function on $W$, 
and $\delta \Theta$ a smooth 1-form on $W$.
We then make the same change of coordinates 
to $(y_0,y_1,y_2,y_3)$ we made in 
\autoref{exa:gibbons-hawking-R4}, and compute that $\delta V$
and $\delta \Theta$ do not contribute to the $\omega_i$ at
$y=0$: thus the \hk structure indeed extends to $y=0$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Eguchi-Hanson space]
This is a case of \autoref{exa:gibbons-hawking}
with two singularities. Fix distinct points
$x_1, x_2 \in \R^3$, let $U = \R^3$, and 
\begin{equation}
  V(x) = \frac{1}{4\pi \norm{x - x_1}} + \frac{1}{4\pi \norm{x - x_2}}.
\end{equation}
The resulting $\bar X$ is fibered over $\R^3$ with two degenerate fibers.
From now on we drop the bar and just call it $X$.
Let $\pi: X \to \R^3$ be the projection.
Then $\pi^{-1}(x_1 x_2)$ has the topology of $S^2$.
\end{example}

\insfig{higgs-bundles-3}{0.8}

\begin{exercise}
Show that this $S^2$ is a complex submanifold of $X$, with
respect to the two complex structures $I_{\vec s}$ where $\vec s$
is the direction from $x_1$ to $x_2$ or vice versa.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Compute the area of this $S^2$, in the \hk metric $g$. (Hint: complex
submanifolds of \kahler manifolds are \ti{calibrated} ---
the area is just $\int \omega_{\vec s}$.)
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Show that this $S^2$ has self-intersection number $-2$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Show that, in either of the complex structures 
$I_{\vec s}$ of the previous
exercise, $X$ is biholomorphic to $T^* \C\PP^1$. \fixme{warning,
this one might be hard}
\end{exercise}

Eguchi-Hanson space is our first example where the $I_{\vec s}$ do not all give rise to the same complex manifold:
\begin{exercise}
Show that, in any \ti{other} complex structure $I_{\vec s'}$,
$X$ has no compact 1-complex-dimensional complex 
submanifolds. (Hint: use the fact that
there is a holomorphic function $z: X \to \C$.
The image of a compact connected 
1-complex-dimensional submanifold
would have to be a point. It might be 
convenient to assume $\vec s$ is generic and $\vec s' = (1,0,0)$,
in which case the relevant function is $z_1$ given in
\eqref{eq:hol-forms-GH}.)
\end{exercise}

Nevertheless we do have a 1-parameter group relating 
\ti{some} of the $I_{\vec s}$:
\begin{exercise}
Show that $X$ admits an action of $SO(2) \subset SO(3)$
by isometries,
such that $T^* I_{\vec s} = I_{T \vec{s}}$. \fixme{check!}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}[Multi-Eguchi-Hanson spaces] \cite{MR520463} \label{exa:multi-eguchi-hanson} More generally, take $U = \R^3$, fix a collection
of distinct points $x_1, \dots, x_k \in \R^3$ and take
\begin{equation}
  V(x) = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{4 \pi \norm{x - x_i}}.
\end{equation}
Then a straight line segment in $\R^3$ connecting two $x_i$ (and not meeting any others)
gives an $S^2$ in $X$. This $S^2$ is a complex submanifold with respect to two of the complex structures $I_{\vec s}$, just as before.

Asymptotically, the metric on this space is approximately
what we would get by taking all $x_i = x_0$ for some fixed $x_0$. 
In that case we would have simply 
\begin{equation}
 V(x) = \frac{k}{4 \pi \norm{x - x_0}}
\end{equation}
which, as explained in \autoref{exa:gibbons-hawking-R4Zk},
gives the \hk structure of $\R^4 / \Z_k$.
Thus, when all the $x_i$ are distinct,
$g$ is a kind of \hk desingularization of $\R^4 / \Z_k$.

A nice special case occurs when all of the $x_i$ are collinear:
then we have a single complex structure in which $X$ contains $k-1$
holomorphic spheres $C_i$, with intersection numbers
$C_i \cdot C_{i+1} = 1$. In this complex structure $X$ is 
the \ti{minimal resolution} of the singularity $\C^2 / \Z_k$
(sometimes called a ``du Val singularity of type $A_{k-1}$,'' e.g.
because the intersection numbers of the $C_i$ make up the
Cartan matrix of type $A_{k-1}$.)
\end{example}

\insfig{higgs-bundles-5}{0.9}

\begin{example}[ALE spaces] \label{exa:ALE-spaces}
One can consider the minimal resolutions $X_\Gamma$
of the singularities at the origin in \autoref{exa:H-quotients}.
Then $X_\Gamma$ is an honest smooth manifold, 
carrying a natural family 
of complete \hk metrics \cite{MR90d:53055}.
These metrics asymptotically approach
the metric on $\R^4 / \Gamma$;
thus the $X_\Gamma$ are called ``ALE spaces'',
for ``asymptotically locally Euclidean.''
In the case $\Gamma = \Z_k$ these \hk metrics are
the same as those of \autoref{exa:multi-eguchi-hanson};
for other $\Gamma$ they are not Gibbons-Hawking spaces.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Taub-NUT space]
This is a case of \autoref{exa:gibbons-hawking}
with one singularity. 
Take $U = \R^3$ and
\begin{equation}
  V(x) = 1 + \frac{1}{4\pi \norm{x-x_0}}.
\end{equation}
Now the asymptotic metric looks like that of $\R^3 \times S^1$
rather than $\R^4$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise} Show that Taub-NUT space is
biholomorphic to $\C^2$, in any of its complex
structures. \fixme{warning, this one might be hard}
\end{exercise}

Despite this, Taub-NUT space is definitely not the same
\hk manifold as $\bbH$! So a \hk manifold contains more 
information than just a family of complex manifolds.

Similarly by taking multiple singularities in $V$ we could
obtain the ``multi-Taub-NUT'' family of metrics.

\subsection{The twistor family}

Given a \hk manifold $X$ we have seen that we get a 
family of complex manifolds $(X,I_{\vec s})$.
This family can be assembled into a \ti{single}
complex manifold, equipped with some extra structure,
which in fact contains all the information necessary
to reconstruct the original \hk $X$.

% Morally, the key fact is that the vector
% bundle $T^{1,0}_{I_{\vec s}} X$ actually varies
% \ti{holomorphically} as a function of $\vec s$,
% when we equip $S^2$ with its standard complex
% structure. 
We know that $\Omega_1 = \omega_2 + \I \omega_3$ is
a holomorphic symplectic form for $I_1$. We can do similarly
for an arbitrary complex structure $I_{\vec s}$, and can
even arrange that the resulting holomorphic symplectic
forms vary holomorphically:

\begin{lem}[Holomorphic symplectic forms on a \hk manifold
vary holomorphically over $S^2$] \label{lem:hol-symp-hol} 
Suppose $X$ is a \hk manifold. 
Let 
\begin{equation}
V = \Span(\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3) \subset \Omega^2_\C(X).
\end{equation}
For each $\vec s \in S^2$, let 
\begin{equation}
 L_{\vec s} = V \cap \Omega^{2,0}_{I_{\vec s}}(X).
\end{equation}
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\dim_\C L_{\vec s} = 1$.
\item If we equip $S^2$ with its standard 
complex structure, $L$ is a \ti{holomorphic} line subbundle of the trivial rank $3$ holomorphic bundle $S^2 \times V$, canonically isomorphic to $\cO(-2) \to \C\PP^1$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

\begin{pf}
For (1) it's enough to compute for $\vec{s} = (1,0,0)$, and there note
$\omega_2 + \I \omega_3 \in \Omega^{2,0}$, $\omega_1 \in \Omega^{1,1}$,
$\omega_2 - \I \omega_3 \in \Omega^{0,2}$. Thus $L_{\vec s}$ is 1-dimensional,
spanned by $\omega_2 + \I \omega_3$.

For (2) here is a computational proof.
Fix a complex coordinate $\zeta$
on $S^2 \setminus \{ (-1,0,0) \}$, by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:zeta-def}
 \zeta = \frac{s_3 - \I s_2}{1 + s_1}, \qquad (s_1, s_2, s_3) = \frac{(1 - \abs{\zeta}^2, -2 \im \zeta, 2 \re \zeta)}{1+\abs{\zeta}^2}.
\end{equation}
Thus we have
\begin{align}
  \zeta = 0 \leftrightarrow \vec s = (1,0,0), \quad & \zeta = \infty \leftrightarrow \vec s = (-1,0,0), \\
  \zeta = -\I \leftrightarrow \vec s = (0,1,0), \quad & \zeta = \I \leftrightarrow \vec s = (0,-1,0), \\
  \zeta = 1 \leftrightarrow \vec s = (0,0,1), \quad & \zeta = -1 \leftrightarrow \vec s = (0,0,-1).
\end{align}
Using this translation we will sometimes write 
$I_\zeta$ for $I_{\vec s}$ and $L_\zeta$ for $L_{\vec s}$.
Now consider the holomorphic family of 2-forms
\begin{equation} \label{eq:hol-symp-family}
  \Omega(\zeta) = \frac{\omega_2 + \I \omega_3}{2\zeta} - \I\omega_1 + \frac{\omega_2 - \I \omega_3}{2} \zeta.
\end{equation}
We want to check that $\Omega(\zeta) \in L_\zeta$.
As a quick check note that
\begin{equation}
  \Omega(\zeta=1) = -\I \Omega_3, \quad \Omega(\zeta=-\I) = - \Omega_2, \quad \zeta \Omega(\zeta=0) = \Omega_1.
\end{equation}
For general $\zeta$, what we want to know is that
that applying $I_\zeta$ to the first slot of $\Omega(\zeta)$ gives
$\I \Omega(\zeta)$, so that $\Omega(\zeta) \in L_\zeta$.
This can be checked (a bit laboriously) 
\mmaref{verify-holsymp}
using \eqref{eq:zeta-def}, $I_i \omega_i = g$,
$I_i \omega_{i+1} = -\omega_{i+2}$, $I_i \omega_{i+2} = \omega_{i+1}$.

Now, $\Omega(\zeta)$ blows up as $\zeta \to 0$ or 
$\zeta \to \infty.$
Still, for any $\zeta \in \C$, $\zeta \Omega(\zeta)$ is
a nonvanishing element of $L_\zeta$;
similarly, for any $\zeta \in \C^\times \cup \{\infty\}$,
$\Omega(\zeta) / \zeta$ is a nonvanishing element of $L_\zeta$.
Thus we have two holomorphic trivializations of $L_\zeta$ over 
these two patches, differing by the transition function $\zeta^{-2}$.
This gives the desired holomorphic identification
$L_\zeta \simeq \cO(-2)$ and finishes the proof.

We will use the formula \eqref{eq:hol-symp-family} frequently.
Warning: different authors (and different papers by the same authors)
have different conventions for the normalization of $\Omega(\zeta)$
and the definition of $\zeta$.

\begin{lem}[$(1,0)$-covectors on a \hk manifold vary holomorphically over $S^2$] \label{lem:10-forms-hol}
Suppose $X$ is a \hk manifold. Then $(T^*)^{1,0}_{I_\zeta} X = (1 - \I \zeta I_3) (T^*)^{1,0}_{I_1} X$.
\end{lem}

\begin{pf}
If $\beta \in T^{1,0}_{I_\zeta} X$ we may compute directly that
\begin{align}
I_\zeta (1 + \zeta I_3) \beta &= \frac{((1 - \abs{\zeta}^2)I_1 - 2 \im \zeta I_2 + 2 \re \zeta I_3)(1 + \zeta I_3)\beta} {1 + \abs{\zeta}^2} \\
&= \I (1 + \zeta I_3) \beta,
\end{align}
so at least $(1 + \zeta I_3) (T^*)^{1,0}_{I_1} X \subset (T^*)^{1,0}_{I_\zeta} X$. Moreover the map $(1 + \zeta I_3)$ is injective on $(T^*)^{1,0}_{I_1} X$,
since $I_3$ and $I_1$ anticommute, so that they cannot have any
simultaneous eigenvectors. So by dimension counting we are done.
\end{pf}

\begin{cor}[$(0,1)$-vectors on a \hk manifold vary holomorphically over $S^2$] \label{cor:01-vectors-hol}
Suppose $X$ is a \hk manifold. Then $T^{0,1}_{I_\zeta} X = (1 + \I \zeta I_3) T^{0,1}_{I_1} X$.
\end{cor}
\begin{pf} Take the complex conjugate of the statement in 
\eqref{lem:10-forms-hol}, and use the metric to identify
$\bar T^* \simeq T$.
\end{pf}

\begin{exercise} Carry out the omitted computation in 
the proof of \autoref{lem:10-forms-hol}. Note a tricky point:
here we are acting on covectors rather than vectors,
so the operators $I_i$ we are using are the \ti{transposes}
of the usual ones, so $I_2 I_1 = I_3$
rather than the usual relation. (Or alternatively,
carry out the analogous computation to 
prove \autoref{cor:01-vectors-hol} directly, in which case
you would use the usual $I_1 I_2 = I_3$.)
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} Use \autoref{lem:10-forms-hol} to give 
an alternative proof of \autoref{lem:hol-symp-hol}.

% Another way of getting at this is: identify $V$ with the imaginary
% quaternions by taking $\omega_i \mapsto I_i$; 
% then $L_{\vec s}$ is the $-\I$ eigenspace 
% of the operator $I_{\vec s}$ acting on the complexification of the subspace
% $\{I_{\vec s'}: s' \perp s\}$ of $V$. (To check this, it's enough to look 
% at $\vec s = (1,0,0)$; then $L_{\vec s}$ is supposed to contain 
% $I_2 + \I I_3$.)  On the other hand the holomorphic tangent bundle $T^{1,0} S^2$
% is the $+\I$ eigenspace of the same operator.

% Yet another proof works as follows. \fixme{explain better}
% Each complex structure $I_{\vec s}$ generates a 1-parameter
% group $U(1)_{\vec s} \subset SU(2)$. All of these subgroups are 
% conjugate, and we can view
% the $S^2$ of unit imaginary quaternions as the coset space
% $SU(2)/U(1)$ parameterizing such subgroups. $U(1)_{\vec s}$
% acts with weights $2,0,-2$ on $V$, and $L_{\vec s}$ is the
% weight-$2$ piece. Now the standard complex structure on $SU(2)/U(1)$
% is such that the complex vector field corresponding to the 
% \ti{raising} generator $X^+ \in \mathfrak{su}(2)_\C$

\begin{defn}[Twistor space] Given a \hk manifold $X$, the \ti{twistor space} of $X$ is the smooth manifold
\begin{equation}
  \cZ = X \times S^2
\end{equation}
equipped with the almost complex structure
\begin{equation}
  I(x,\vec s) = I_{\vec s}(x) \oplus I_{S^2}
\end{equation}
where $I_{S^2}$ denotes the 
standard complex structure on $S^2$.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}[Twistor space is a complex manifold] The almost complex structure $I$ on $\cZ$ is integrable.
\end{prop}
\begin{pf}
What we will use is that $\Omega(\zeta)$ determines the complex structure fiberwise,
and $\Omega(\zeta)$ itself is holomorphic in $\zeta$.
(For a different proof, using instead \autoref{lem:10-forms-hol},
see \cite{Hitchin:1986ea}.)

Concretely: we have 
\begin{equation}
T^{0,1}_{(x,\zeta)} \cZ = T^{0,1}_{x,I_\zeta} X \oplus T^{0,1}_\zeta S^2.
\end{equation}
To see the integrability, consider a pair of vector fields in $T^{0,1} \cZ$,
of the form $v \oplus v'$
and $w \oplus w'$ with respect to this decomposition.

Part of the story is easy.
Since $v$ and $w$ are both tangent to the fiber $X_{\zeta} = \pi^{-1}(\zeta)$
the bracket $[v,w]$ is just the bracket on $X_{\zeta}$, and we already
know the integrability there, so $[v,w] \in T^{0,1} X$.
Since $v'$ and $w'$ are both pulled back from the base $S^2$,
their bracket $[v',w']$ is also pulled back from the bracket on $S^2$,
and we already know the integrability there, so again $[v',w'] \in T^{0,1} S^2$.

All that remains is to check
that $[v,w'] \subset T^{0,1} \cZ$.
Choose local coordinates $x^i$ for $X$ and write 
\begin{equation}
v = v^i(x,\zeta) \partial_i, \qquad w' = f(x,\zeta) \partial_{\bar \zeta}, \qquad
\Omega = \Omega_{ij}(\zeta) \de x^i \wedge \de x^j. 
\end{equation}
Here $v \in T^{0,1} X$ means it obeys the constraint
\begin{equation} \label{eq:v-constraint}
\Omega_{ij}(\zeta) v^i = 0.
\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}
 [v, f \partial_{\bar \zeta}] = (v^i \partial_i f) \partial_{\bar \zeta} - (\partial_{\bar \zeta} v^i) \partial_i.
\end{equation}
The first term is evidently in $T^{0,1} S^2$; for the second term note that
applying $\partial_{\bar \zeta}$ to \eqref{eq:v-constraint}
gives $\Omega_{ij}(\zeta) \partial_{\bar \zeta} v^i = 0$,
so the second term is in $T^{0,1} X$; thus the whole RHS is 
in $T^{0,1} \cZ$, which is what we want.
\end{pf}


\begin{example}[Twistor space of $\R^4$] \label{exa:R4-twistor-space}
For the standard \hk structure on $\bbH$ all this becomes very 
concrete. 
If we define
\begin{align}
  w(\zeta) &= w_1 - \bar{z}_1 \zeta, \\
  z(\zeta) &= z_1 + \bar{w}_1 \zeta,
\end{align}
then the holomorphic $2$-form \eqref{eq:hol-symp-family}
can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \Omega(\zeta) = \frac{1}{2\zeta} \de w(\zeta) \wedge \de z(\zeta)
\end{equation}
Indeed,
\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{2\zeta} \de w(\zeta) \wedge \de z(\zeta) &= \frac{1}{2\zeta} (\de w_1 \wedge \de z_1 + \zeta (\de w_1 \wedge \de \bar{w}_i + \de z_1 \wedge \de \bar{z}_1) - \zeta^2 \de \bar{z}_1 \wedge \de \bar{w}_1) \\
  &= \frac{\omega_2 + \I \omega_3}{2\zeta} - \I\omega_1 + \frac{\omega_2 - \I \omega_3}{2} \zeta
\end{align}
matching \eqref{eq:hol-symp-family}.

It follows (using the result of \autoref{exc:hsymp-holomorphy} below)
that $w(\zeta)$ and $z(\zeta)$ are fiberwise holomorphic.
But they are evidently also holomorphic in $\zeta$. So they are 
holomorphic functions on $\cZ$.
Thus we have two coordinate systems on $\cZ$:
$(\zeta, z(\zeta), w(\zeta))$
covering the patch $\zeta \neq \infty$ and $(1/\zeta, z(\zeta)/\zeta, w(\zeta)/\zeta)$ covering $\zeta \neq 0$. The transition map 
in the fibers is thus multiplication by $1/\zeta$.
This identifies
$\cZ$ as the total space of the rank $2$ holomorphic bundle
\begin{equation}
  \cO(1) \oplus \cO(1) \to S^2.
\end{equation}
This space comes with a natural antiholomorphic involution:
on $\R^4 \times S^2$ it is simply $\rho(x,\vec s) = (x,-\vec s)$.
In the holomorphic coordinates this becomes
\begin{equation} \label{eq:involution-R4}
  \rho(\zeta, z, w) = (-1/\bar\zeta, -\bar w / \bar\zeta, \bar z / \bar \zeta).
\end{equation}
\end{example}

\begin{exercise} \label{exc:hsymp-holomorphy}
If $X$ is a complex manifold, with $\dim_\C X = 2$, with holomorphic symplectic form
$\Omega$, and $\Omega = \alpha \wedge \beta$ for $\alpha,\beta \in \Omega^1(X)$, 
show that in fact $\alpha, \beta \in \Omega^{1,0}(X)$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}[Twistor space of $\R^3 \times S^1$]  \label{exa:R3S1-twistor-space}
For $\R^3 \times S^1$ the picture is more interesting.
The shift by $\Z$ acts as $(w_1,z_1) \to (w_1 + 2 \pi n, z_1)$.
We can build coordinates by taking shift-invariant 
combinations of the coordinates we used in 
\autoref{exa:R4-twistor-space}:
on the patch $\zeta \neq \infty$ we take
\begin{equation}
 \eta = z - \zeta w, \qquad \cX = \exp(\I w)
\end{equation}
while on $\zeta \neq 0$ we take
\begin{equation}
 \eta' = z / \zeta^2 - w / \zeta, \qquad \cX' = \exp(\I z / \zeta)
\end{equation}
Thus the transition map is
\begin{equation}
  (\zeta', \eta', \cX') = (1 / \zeta, \eta / \zeta^2, \cX \exp(\I \eta / \zeta) )
\end{equation}
So $\eta$ is a local coordinate on the fiber of $\cO(2) \to S^2$;
let $L$ denote the line bundle over $\cO(2) \to S^2$ with 
transition function $e^{\I \eta / 2 \zeta}$; what we just showed
is that $\cZ$ is the total space of $L^2$, with the
zero section deleted (because $\cX$ never takes the value $0$.)

Note that in particular $\cZ$ is \ti{not} algebraic, because of the
appearance of the exponential function here. (Were it algebraic,
it would follow on general grounds that $L$ is pulled back from 
the base $\C\PP^1$, but that's not the case here (I think.))
\end{example}

\begin{exercise} Write down the holomorphic symplectic form 
$\Omega$ and the real structure $\rho$ in these complex 
coordinates for $\cZ$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}[$\R^2 \times T^2$]
Now fix some $\tau$ in the upper half-plane.

Let $X$ be $\R^4$ modulo shifts of $w_1$ by $2\pi(\Z \oplus \Z \tau)$.
Note we have made a choice here, which privileges complex structure 
$I_1$. Indeed in structure $I_1$ we see immediately
that
\begin{equation}
  X \simeq \C \times T^2_\tau,
\end{equation}
where by $T^2_\tau$ we mean the complex 
torus $\C / (\Z \oplus \Z \tau)$.
Similarly in structure $-I_1$ we have
\begin{equation}
  X \simeq \C \times T^2_{-\bar\tau}.
\end{equation}

What about the other structures, for $\zeta \in \C^\times$?
Let's start with the slightly easier case $\tau = \I$.
In this case the periodicity is just shifts of $x_0$ and $x_1$
by $2\pi$.
Away from $\zeta = 0$ and $\zeta = \infty$, we can write
holomorphic coordinates as
\begin{align*}
  \cX_A &= \exp \left(\frac{z_1}{2\zeta} - \I x_1 + \frac{\bar{z}_1}{2} \zeta \right),\\
  \cX_B &= \exp \left(\frac{\I z_1}{2\zeta} + \I x_0 - \frac{\I \bar{z}_1}{2}  \zeta \right).
\end{align*}
As a check, note that at $\zeta = 1$ we have
$\cX_A = \exp(x_2 - \I x_1)$, $\cX_B = \exp(-x_3 + \I x_0)$, holomorphic
for $I_3$,
and at $\zeta = -\I$ we have
$\cX_A = \exp(- x_3 - \I x_1)$, $\cX_B = \exp(-x_2 + \I x_0)$,
holomorphic for $I_2$.
In general we compute directly
\begin{equation} \label{eq:hol-symp-R2T2}
  \frac{\de \cX_A \wedge \de \cX_B}{\cX_A \cX_B} = -\I \Omega(\zeta),
\end{equation}
which shows in particular that $\cX_A$ and $\cX_B$ are holomorphic
on $(X,I_\zeta)$.
Thus, for all $\zeta \in \C^\times$, we get in structure $I_\zeta$
\begin{equation}
 X \simeq \C^\times \times \C^\times. 
\end{equation}
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Check \eqref{eq:hol-symp-R2T2}. Note that, as we have explained,
this immediately implies that $\cX_A$ and $\cX_B$ are indeed
holomorphic. If you are interested, you might also
try checking this directly using the definition of $I_\zeta$.
\end{exercise}

Let us describe some of the abstract properties of $\cZ$:
\begin{prop}[Properties of twistor space]
Suppose $X$ is a \hk manifold with twistor space $\cZ$. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\cZ$ is a complex manifold, with a 
  holomorphic projection $\pi: \cZ \to S^2$.
  The fiber $\pi^{-1}(\vec s)$ is isomorphic to
  $(X,I_{\vec s})$ as a complex manifold. 
\item $\cZ$, as a bundle over $S^2$, 
has holomorphic \ti{sections} $s_x$ corresponding
to the points $x \in X$.
The normal bundle to $s_x(S^2) \subset \cZ$ is isomorphic
to $\cO(1)^{\oplus 2n}$.
\item $\cZ$ carries a twisted fiberwise holomorphic symplectic form,
\begin{equation}
  \Omega \in \Omega^{2,0}_{fiber}(\cZ) \otimes \pi^* \cO(2)
\end{equation}
where $\Omega^{2,0}_{fiber}(\cZ) = \wedge^2 (T^{1,0}_{vert} \cZ)^*$.
\item $\cZ$ carries a \ti{real structure} $\rho: \cZ \to \cZ$,
i.e. an antiholomorphic involution.
All the other structures are compatible with $\rho$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\rho$ covers the antipodal involution $\sigma$ on $S^2$
\fixme{add commutative diagram},
\item $s_x(-\vec s) = \rho(s_x(s))$,
\item $\rho^* \Omega = -\overline\Omega$.
(To formulate this condition we need some care, since 
$\Omega$ is twisted by $\cO(2)$; we fix a lift
of $\rho$ to $\cO(2)$ by requiring that in the
standard trivialization of $\cO(2)$, $\rho$ acts
trivially.)
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{pf}
We already proved (1). For (2) set
\begin{equation}
  s_x(\zeta) = (x,\zeta).
\end{equation}
The desired statement about the normal bundle to $s_x(S^2)$ follows from
\autoref{lem:10-forms-hol}: indeed choosing a basis
$\{\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_{2n}\}$ 
for the $2n$-dimensional vector space
$(T^{1,0}_{x,I_1} X)^*$ we get $2n$ 
trivializations of the conormal bundle to $s_x(S^2)$, namely
by the sections
$\{(1 + \zeta I_3) \alpha_i \oplus 0 \}$ 
over $\{\zeta \neq 0\}$ and $\{(1/\zeta + I_3) \alpha_i\} \oplus 0$
over $\{\zeta \neq \infty\}$. The transition function
relating these two trivializations is $1/\zeta {\mathbf 1}$,
showing the conormal bundle is $\cO(-1)^{\oplus 2n}$,
thus the normal bundle is $\cO(1)^{\oplus 2n}$ as desired.
For (3) use the $\Omega$ of \eqref{eq:hol-symp-family}.
Finally for (4) take
\begin{equation}
  \rho(x, \vec s) = (x, - \vec s).
\end{equation}
The statement that $\rho^* \Omega = -\bar\Omega$ then 
amounts to the fact that if we substitute $- 1 / \bar\zeta$
in \eqref{eq:hol-symp-family} we get $-\bar\Omega$.
